                    <p>There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
                        in the pathless woods, 
                        There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
                        There is society where
                        none intrudes, By the deep
                        Sea, and music in its roar:
                        I love not Man the less,
                        but nature more.
